# Testing & Quality

## Testing Framework

- Use **Jest** for unit and integration tests.

## Mocking Strategy

- Mock AI services during tests to avoid live API calls.

## Test Coverage

- Test authentication, CRUD operations, AI-generated content, and payment flows.
- Ensure minimum 80% code coverage for critical backend services.
